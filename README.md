## Introduction
In this repository, you will find my solutions to various LeetCode daily problems and Codeforces questions. Each problem has its own dedicated folder, where you can find the problem statement, my solution, and any additional notes or explanations.

The solutions are written in Python, providing clear and concise implementations of the algorithms and data structures required to solve the given problems. You can use these solutions as a reference to understand different approaches and techniques for problem-solving in Python.

## LeetCode Daily Problems
The LeetCode Daily Problems section contains a collection of solutions to the daily coding challenges provided by LeetCode. Each problem is categorized under its respective difficulty level (Easy, Medium, or Hard) and includes the problem description, my solution, and the corresponding runtime and memory usage analysis.

Feel free to explore the different folders and examine the solutions. If you find any issues or have alternative solutions that you would like to contribute, please follow the contributing guidelines.
