### Problem Description 📜

You're given a 1D integer array `original` and two integers, `m` and `n`. Your task is to create a 2D array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all the elements from `original`. The elements from indices 0 to `n - 1` of `original` should form the first row of the 2D array, the elements from indices `n` to `2 * n - 1` should form the second row, and so on.

If it's not possible to form such a 2D array because the length of `original` isn't equal to `m * n`, return an empty 2D array.

### Example Explanations 📚

**Example 1:**
```
Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Explanation: The 2D array should have 2 rows and 2 columns:
- First row: [1, 2]
- Second row: [3, 4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3]]
Explanation: The 2D array should have 1 row and 3 columns:
- First row: [1, 2, 3]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
Output: []
Explanation: It's impossible to fit 2 elements in a 1x1 array, so return an empty array.
```

### Solution Explanation 💡

1. **Check Feasibility**: 🛑 First, verify if the length of the `original` array is equal to `m * n`. If not, return an empty array as it's impossible to form the desired 2D array.
  
2. **Construct the 2D Array**: 🧩 If feasible, use nested loops to fill the 2D array. The outer loop will iterate over the number of rows (`m`), and the inner loop will collect `n` elements for each row.

3. **Alternative Using NumPy**: 🚀 You can also use NumPy for a more compact solution. Use the `reshape` method to transform the 1D array into the desired 2D shape. Handle errors using a try-except block.

### Emoji Explanation 📝

- **🛑 Check Feasibility**: Verify if the transformation is possible by checking if the length matches `m * n`.
- **🧩 Construct the 2D Array**: Iterate through the original array to populate the rows of the 2D array.
- **🚀 Alternative Using NumPy**: Use NumPy's `reshape` method for a more efficient implementation.

### Solution Code in Python 🐍

#### Python (Without NumPy)
```python
class Solution:
    def construct2DArray(self, original: List[int], m: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # 🛑 Check if the transformation is possible
        if m * n != len(original):
            return []
        
        # 🧩 Construct the 2D array
        arr = []
        for i in range(m):
            row = []
            for j in range(n):
                row.append(original[i * n + j])
            arr.append(row)
        return arr
```

#### Python (With NumPy) 🚀
```python
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    def construct2DArray(self, original: List[int], m: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        try:
            # 🚀 Use NumPy to reshape the array
            return np.array(original).reshape(m, n).tolist()
        except:
            return []
```

### Summary 🌟

- **Problem**: Convert a 1D array to a 2D array with specified dimensions.
- **Solution**:
  - Check if the transformation is feasible by comparing the lengths.
  - Construct the 2D array manually or use NumPy's `reshape` method for a more efficient solution.
