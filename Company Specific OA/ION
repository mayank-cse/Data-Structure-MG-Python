Step 1 = Find Value i.e. profit, by subtracting futureValue - currentValue
Step 2 = Apply 0/1 Knapsack -> take or notTake 
**********************************************
Q2 - given an arr of size n and profits of size k. Do exactly k/2 Operations of choosing i and j such that 0<=i<j<|power|. 
step 1 = find the consecutive subarray sum from start for all elements
step 2 = apply 2 pointer 
left = 0, right = k//2-1
while l<r:
    ans += pre[r] - (0 if pre[l]<0 else pre[l]-1)
    r--
    l++
return ans
