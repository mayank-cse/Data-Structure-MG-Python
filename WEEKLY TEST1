The value of an alphanumeric string can be defined as:

The numeric representation of the string in base 10, if it comprises of digits only.
The length of the string, otherwise.
Given an array strs of alphanumeric strings, return the maximum value of any string in strs.

 

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["alic3","bob","3","4","00000"]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
- "alic3" consists of both letters and digits, so its value is its length, i.e. 5.
- "bob" consists only of letters, so its value is also its length, i.e. 3.
- "3" consists only of digits, so its value is its numeric equivalent, i.e. 3.
- "4" also consists only of digits, so its value is 4.
- "00000" consists only of digits, so its value is 0.
Hence, the maximum value is 5, of "alic3".
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["1","01","001","0001"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Each string in the array has value 1. Hence, we return 1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 100
1 <= strs[i].length <= 9
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters and digits.

        return 1 #//numeric
    def maximumValue(self, strs: List[str]) -> int:
        myList = [*range(0,len(strs),1)]
        
        for i in range(0, len(strs)):
            if(self.check(strs[i])==0):
                myList[i] = len(strs[i])
            else:
                myList[i] = int(strs[i])
        return max(myList)

There is an undirected graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 0-indexed integer array vals of length n where vals[i] denotes the value of the ith node.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.

A star graph is a subgraph of the given graph having a center node containing 0 or more neighbors. In other words, it is a subset of edges of the given graph such that there exists a common node for all edges.

The image below shows star graphs with 3 and 4 neighbors respectively, centered at the blue node.


The star sum is the sum of the values of all the nodes present in the star graph.

Given an integer k, return the maximum star sum of a star graph containing at most k edges.

 

Example 1:


Input: vals = [1,2,3,4,10,-10,-20], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5],[3,6]], k = 2
Output: 16
Explanation: The above diagram represents the input graph.
The star graph with the maximum star sum is denoted by blue. It is centered at 3 and includes its neighbors 1 and 4.
It can be shown it is not possible to get a star graph with a sum greater than 16.
Example 2:

Input: vals = [-5], edges = [], k = 0
Output: -5
Explanation: There is only one possible star graph, which is node 0 itself.
Hence, we return -5.
 

Constraints:

n == vals.length
1 <= n <= 105
-104 <= vals[i] <= 104
0 <= edges.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 105)
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
ai != bi
0 <= k <= n - 1
